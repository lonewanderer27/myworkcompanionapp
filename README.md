# My Work Companion

An internal application that helps me manage track my job applications, schedule interviews, and interact with an AI chatbot for email responses.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). 

## Features

### Jobs

- List of jobs that you have applied to.
- Track the status of each job application.

### Calendar

- Schedule of interviews and other important events.

### Threads

- Each thread is a conversation with an AI chatbot that helps you reply to email responses based on various criteria.
- Integration with Gemini for AI responses.

### Profile

- Set up your personal information.
- Generate your own resume/CV based on the information provided.
- Use an HTML template to fill in your resume/CV details.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- Expo Go, a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the app directory. This project uses file-based routing.
